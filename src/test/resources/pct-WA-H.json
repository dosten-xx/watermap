The Norse Peak Fire started during a lightning storm on August 11, 2017. That storm ignited 13 fires within the Naches Ranger District of Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Washington. The trail closure is composed of two separate orders because the cascade crest is also the boundary between the Mt Baker-Snoqualmie NF and the Okanogan Wenatchee NF.\nMt Baker-Snoqualmie NF alerts and notices page --\u003e https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/mbs/alerts-notices\nOkanogan Wenatchee NF closure order page --\u003e https://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/okawen/alerts-notices/?cid=fseprd521011&width=full\nIn Spring 2018, after the snow has melted, we’ll work with the U.S. Forest Service in the area to scout the trail, assess whether it needs to remain closed and what we can recommend for a detour. We’ll update this page as soon as we have a recommendation.\nSeattle Public Utility staff sent us the following important note:\nPLEASE get the message out to the thru-hiker community that the PCT closure in WA state, due to the Norse Peak Fire, does not allow hiking on/in the Cedar River Watershed. The Cedar River Watershed is owned by the City of Seattle (90,000+ acres) and is the unfiltered water source for almost a million people. Trespass onto City property is a misdemeaner and heavily enforced. Hikers are ending up near Ravensdale WA with almost no options to get back to the trail. Going NW through the Green Watershed is bascially a dead-end without walking along major highways (Highway 18 to 90)."

      "DIAMOND CREEK FIRE (Pasayten Wilderness)\nhttps://www.pcta.org/discover-the-trail/trail-condition/diamond-creek-fire-pasayten/ (contains interactive map showing the fire and side trails)\nhttps://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/5409/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/diamondcreekfire2017/\n9/20/17 (PCTA) : The Diamond Creek Fire is a huge fire that’s burning near the northern end of the PCT. It’s east of the trail by about 7.5-10 miles. It needs to be closely considered before you head north of Rainy Pass (mile 2589). It started in July. Thankfully, recent rain, snow, and firefighting efforts have significantly reduced fire activity.The Pacific Crest Trail remains open.\nCarry paper maps that show the region to the west of the PCT and be prepared\nWe recommend that all hikers heading north of Rainy Pass carry paper maps that show the bail-out routes to the west of the PCT. Know your options.\nIf the fire grows in size again, you may want to take the Pacific Northwest Trail (PNT, http://pnt.org/) west from Holman Pass. You can either:\n1) Walk the PNT to Ross Lake and then down to the East Bank Trailhead (30 miles). You’ll need a permit from North Cascades National Park (https://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/permits.htm) to do this hike.\n2) Walk the PNT to Devils Pass (8 miles) and then the Jackita Trail #738 to Canyon Creek Trailhead (14 miles, for a total distance of 22 miles). This trail is steep, narrow in places and it is not recommended for stock.\nYou can download some 1:50,000 scale maps that show the PNT and Jackita Trail at https://www.pcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PNT-and-Jackita-Ridge-Trail-map.pdf?x41206. You can also download very good maps from our friends at the Pacific Northwest Trail Association at http://pnt.org/maps/ (navigate to Section 6).\nRoss Lake Resort (http://www.rosslakeresort.com/index.html) runs boat shuttles on the lake that you might find a use for.\nThe Boundary Trail/Castle Pass Trail from Castle Pass near the border is unmaintained and not recommended. It’s in very bad shape and is extremely difficult to follow.\nCheck the weather forecasts for high winds, wind direction shifts, warm temperatures, lightning, and know how to react to wildfires.\nIt’s important to note that the Canada Border Service Agency permit allows you to cross into Canada only on the Pacific Crest Trail. You may not cross into Canada on other trails."
