It's hard hiking, hard route finding and dangerous on the traverses. Crampons needed. A lot of blowdowns. Tree wells are a problem as are snow bridges. Snow is soft on exposed areas and hard in the trees. Stick to the crest or south sided forest service roads when the trail goes on the north side of the mountains. It's slow going and difficult. This is not a place to go if you're trying to avoid snow. Oh, and the bears are out."

      "9/13/17 (I-Beam): I wanted to pass on to you some information I received through an email exchange with the Forest Service concerning the missing handle on the water pump at Brown Mountain Shelter at mile 1760.8.  It turns out that it was the Forest Service that removed the handle in early June because there were some issues with maintenance of the water system and they didn’t want hikers using the water until the maintenance was completed.   They originally thought they would have it fixed by “mid hiking season” but because of the multiple fires this season resources had to be directed to fighting fires and they have not been able to do the required maintenance and do not expect to have it done this year. \n8/2/17 (Numbers) : Pump still has no handle. The stream by the road at 1761.0 is currently a couple of usable puddles and has no visible flow. There appeared to be only one water source north of the road, at 1762.0, and it was a usable shallow puddle about 10 ft west of the trail with barely a trickle of flow. If you're using guthook, the 1762.0 source is right at the blue line on the topo map, about 75 ft south on the trail from a dry, rocky creek bed. Otherwise, there's no water until hwy 140 at mile 1770.9. The nearest water source to the south is the piped spring at 1752.7, and if the rangers cant get the pump at South Brown Mountain Shelter fixed, this section will likely soon become an 18.2 mile dry stretch.\n8/2/17 (Optimistic Turtle) : pump broken so no water.There is water by the road mi 1761 but, spring is running very slow, creates a small puddle. Need scoop. This water source is crucial because next miles to Fish Lake the trail is hot very rocky on lavas. Stock up some water!\n8/1/17 (Electro) : Water pump is busted and four people couldn't find any nearby stream.\n7/28/17 (Pika & Laundry Mat) : didn't go to the shelter. Continued on PCT to dirt road at mile 1761, small spring flow from ground south of dirt road, pools to submerge water bottles\n7/22/17 (Santa / Tyee) : pump still broken. RD1761 Stream still flowing.  It’s getting muddy on south side and damaging the plant life.  The north has been brushed so you can access a nice pool of water from the culvert. Some 2 springs still flowing between RD1761 and 1762.1. One useable and one need more development.\n7/7/17 (Halfmile) : pump still broken (missing handle), no access to water. 0.2 miles north  of Brown Mtn Shelter is a seasonal stream near road has clear water flowing about 1 L / min. Stream bank is muddy near road, but OK 25 feet upstream.\n6/27/17 (Rudolph) : Does not work. Talked to forest ranger who said they were aware and planned to fix it but no ETA. On trail at road junction (1761.0) just north of Shelter is a small creek. Muddy and messy to access but has moderate flow \u003e 1 liter per minute. There is a culvert under the road for this creek so it seems this must have fairly consistent water. Between creek at road junction (1761.0) and seasonal spring listed in water report (at 1762.0) is another moderate flowing creek with large pools. I didn't get exact miles, but sat pretty close to halfway making it 1761.5. \n6/20/17 (I-Beam) : The handle on the pump is gone at Brown Mt.

We recommend that northbound PCT hikers leave the PCT at Timberline Lodge rather than Lolo Pass.\nResources\nMountain Express Bus Schedule:  http://www.mthoodexpress.com/schedule-map\nMt. Hood National Forest Alerts: https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/mthood/alerts-notices\nCRGNSA Alerts:  https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/crgnsa/alerts-notices\nOptions for getting around this closure\n1) Shuttle from Bend to Stevenson, WA:  this option bypasses all the trail closures related to fires on the Mt. Hood and Willamette National Forests and the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.\n2) Shuttle from Timberline Lodge to Stevenson, WA:  This option is for hikers who are coming from Olallie Lakes area, north to the Mt. Hood Wilderness. Hikers can hike a hundred yards south from the PCT to Timberline Lodge. From this point, the Mt. Express bus has service to Sandy, Oregon, which has connecting public transportation on the SAM bus into Gresham, Oregon. One-way fare is $2 on the Mountain Express.\n3) Lolo Pass Road to Highway 26 (not recommend at this time):  Hikers can cover the Mt. Hood Wilderness section of the PCT from Timberline Lodge to Lolo Pass Road. Hikers will then need to hike out from the junction with Lolo Pass road, to Highway 26 – about 10.6 miles.  From this point hikers will be near the village of Zigzag, Oregon. In Zigzag there are public transportation points for the Mountain Express bus to take hikers to the town of Sandy, Oregon, and on to Gresham, Oregon.\nNOTE: The maps direct you to travel I-84 and the Bridge of the Gods. Both the road and bridge are currently closed due to the fire. Check road conditions before you head to Cascade Locks."
