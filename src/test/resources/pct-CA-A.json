The Pacific Crest Trail was extensively damaged with up to 2 miles of the trail being lost as a result of damages caused by the Mountain Fire. Years of work has gone into reopening the PCT and the effort continues. The trail is reopening in three phases. Phase 1 opened in November 1016 and phase 2 opened in November 2017 (https://www.pcta.org/2017/burned-fire-two-miles-pct-san-jacinto-mountains-reopen-55167/).\nOfficial documents --\u003e The Mountain Fire closure is administered by San Bernardino National Forest and closure order, map and other documents can be found at https://www.pcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Signed-Moutain-Fire-Closure-Order.pdf?x92830.\nDetour information --\u003e We’re working on new maps that will show the route from the Spitler Peak Trail to Idyllwild and then back to the PCT."

Easier to refill 1 or 2 tenths downstream.\nDetour Mile ~1.9 --  5/9/17 (Numbers): Just before parking area, good flow. Right before a road/parking area. The road crosses this stream again, but the first time is the best water per Pika & Paw Patrol on 4/15/17-----\nDetour Mile ~2.5 -- Small patches of Poodle Dog Bush. per Brian on 4/15/17-----\nDetour Mile 6.2 -- Garner Valley Fire Station #53 (Riverside County) at corner of Morris Ranch Rd & CA-74:  (benches & picnic table with hose bib (24/7) out front near fire truck doors (source front desk).

The main trail of Coyote Run is wide and easy to follow so be sure to take the (small) left trail at the first trail junction  to get to May Valley road.\n4/9/17 (Dalem): water faucets at Hurkey Campground are on. The next water is on Bonita Vista road starting at the junction of May Valley Rd.  The streams runs down the rut in the road but was sufficient to give me a liter of water in less than a minute. Big Cedar tank is dry and the spring appears to be only a damp spot.\n8/13/16 (Linda): Walk through campground to camp sites 65-66.  Go between camp sites to fence line gate in rear.  Zig-zag opening beginning of bike path\nDetour Mile ~13.5 -- If you are going into Idyllwild via May Valley Road/Saunders Meadow Road: There is water right after junction between 5S05 (May Valley Road) and 5S21 (Saunders Meadow Road, road you turn left on to go down to Idyllwild).

      "Little Tahquitz Valley (Trail, 0.33 mi N)  Little Tahquitz Valley is running with water.  Walk over to the creekbed to find water as needed, when the trail begins to parallel the narrow grassy meadow to your R.  If you continue down the trail N another  1/3 mi  into Tahquitz Valley (Tahquitz Meadow), the creek in Tahquitz Valley is also running well and is approx 12\" w X 2-3\" deep, fast moving, clear (you are walking N from the PCT towards Skunk Cabbage on the Tahquitz Valley-Little Tahquitz Valley trail).\n \nIn Tahquitz Valley (Tahquitz Meadow), the Forest Service water tap is approximately 200 yds past Tahquitz Creek.  Running approximately 4 gpm.   As you walk North from the creek, look for a large log to your right (east) about 60' off the trail in the meadow.  Walk towards it.  When you get to the log, turn L (due north).  You will hear water gurgling about 10' from the north tip of the log.  Look down and you will see a 1\" pvc tap from which water is running.  If you miss the log from the trail and hit the 4 way junction (which will take you to Saddle Junction), walk back south approx 100 yards back towards the meadow.  You will pass through a small, shaded ravine on your way back.  The log will appear in the meadow just past that ravine, now on your L.",
