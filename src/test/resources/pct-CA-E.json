When you enter the campground, follow the road straight on (right from the picnic tables) to the toilet building. \n2. Continue walking along the road (on right side of the toilet) until you come to a junction.\n3. Take the road to the right that goes up.\n4. After about a minute walking you come to a new junction (with the Sawmill Campground sign). Take the road to the left that goes up.\n5. After about 300 feet you will pass a small turn around loop on the left side (north). \n6. A little bit further is a wooden sign and you will see in front of you, on the right side, a group of pines on a cleared slope. Look for a worn path up through the grass and take the worn path.\n7. Go up, just behind the pines, onto this grassy hill and walk towards the big solo pine on the top. (South)\n8. Walk to the right of it to a pine with two tops (looks a bit crooked). The water is just behind it at 34.6975, -118.5702 (The low guzzler roof is flat ridged metal about 25'/7.5m square).\n"
