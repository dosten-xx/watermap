After about 300 feet you will pass a small turn around loop on the left side (north). \n6. A little bit further is a wooden sign and you will see in front of you, on the right side, a group of pines on a cleared slope. Look for a worn path up through the grass and take the worn path.\n7. Go up, just behind the pines, onto this grassy hill and walk towards the big solo pine on the top. (South)\n8. Walk to the right of it to a pine with two tops (looks a bit crooked). The water is just behind it at 34.6975, -118.5702 (The low guzzler roof is flat ridged metal about 25'/7.5m square).\n"

      "Tehachapi to Walker Pass is the driest section of the Pacific Crest Trial. This section is also much more remote than any of the previous PCT sections with fewer road crossings, and almost no cell phone service. Mary, who once maintained several water caches in this section, is no longer able to maintain them. A reliable water cache in this area will require more than 1,000+ gallons of water per hiking season and to the best of our knowledge no one is currently able to provide that much water in this remote section of the PCT. Carry extra water and don't expect to find any reliable water caches in this section of the PCT. "

This one lacks no trespassing signs, and implicitly invites hikers to use it by cautioning them to preserve the water source by camping at minimum distance from it.
