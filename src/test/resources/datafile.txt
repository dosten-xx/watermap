2012-07-23	Limber Pine (.3 mi.west)	Flow is good.	2012-07-22	David Hull
2012-07-23	Jackstraw	Two Flowing streams. Not creeks by any means, but definitely sufficient for filtering water from - The westerly flow line (approximately 100 feet west of the first or easterly flowline) probably the better of the two at at least 2 gallons per permit. Both are flowing and clean	2012-07-21	Cameron
2012-07-23	Trailfork	Water flow is low, but still flowing. If you carve out a little bowl to filter from, the flow is more than your filter can take in. Jackstraw Springs has much better flow.	2012-07-21	Cameron
2012-07-31	Fish Creek Saddle	Water at Lodgepole spring about 0.5 mi down the use trail from the saddle to Dry Lake	2012-07-28	HanhN

2012-09-04	Saxton Trailcamp (.2 mi.west)	Spring below camp is running well but low. Very clear. Two springs above camp (farther than the spring below): 1st is just a trickle but second is running low but well. 	2012-09-02	Corrina Peipon
2012-09-04	High Creek Trailcamp	This was my first time at this camp, so I can't say for sure, but it looks like this is two streams or one big stream in winter/spring; now it's one small stream. Water is very clear and cold and steadily flowing from a small falls, but it's a little low compared to what I imagine must be a large stream in other seasons. 	2012-09-02	Corrina Peipon
2012-09-04	High Creek Trailcamp	Stream below camp is low but running steadily. Not as well aerated as other streams higher up on Vivian but plenty of water to filter. 	2012-09-03	Corrina Peipon

2012-10-03	Fish Creek Saddle	The (very) small spring WNW of Fish Creek Saddle was barely running.  You'd be better off just going down to Lodgepole Spring.	2012-09-13	Hikin' Jim
2012-10-03	South Fork Meadows	Water galore (as usual).  Never a shortage here.	2012-09-14	Hikin' Jim
2012-10-03	South Fork Meadows	This post is really for Mosquito Spring which is just east of Grinnell Ridge Camp:  There was water in a small pool at Mosquito Spring, but there wasn't a lot, and it was a bit stagnant and contained mosquito larvae.  You'd *definitely* want to treat this water.	2012-09-13	Hikin' Jim
2012-10-08	Halfway Trailcamp	Good water source from small creek before the split to High Creek trail.	2012-10-06	Tavis

2013-05-27	Limber Pine (.3 mi.west)	Flow is good.	2013-05-25	David Hull
2013-05-27	Dollar Lake	There's no water in the springs at Dollar (can't call it a lake for now - it is bone dry). We had to melt snow. After talking to every group around, we found water to filter at High Meadow Springs. Wish we had known to camp there. Don't rely on the Ranger Station staff - they said there was water! Lodgepole supposedly has a good enough flow at the springs there based on groups we met coming down.	2013-05-25	scout hiker
2013-05-28	Columbine	No water in the creek that runs through camp.  Follow the dry creekbed uphill about 300 yds. (Steep, no defined trail) to a good source.  Best to ask someone who has been there to point you in the right direction.	2013-05-27	Karen

2014-05-05	Dobbs Trailcamp	Both E and W Forks running well.  One of the most reliable water sources in the wilderness.	2014-05-04	Hikin' Jim
2014-05-05	Saxton Trailcamp (.2 mi.west)	The W Prong of the W Fork of Falls Creek (the usual water source) was running well.   -  - The small creek just before the W Prong was also running, albeit at a much lower rate. -  - The spring just up the trail from Saxton was flowing, but just barely. -  - Plummer Crossing (the last water before Dollar Lake Saddle) was flowing well as always.	2014-05-03	Hikin' Jim

2014-05-18	Lodgepole Spring	3 small puddles remain.  There is no "flowing" water at all.  Two San G volunteers, who were visiting Lodgepole Spring on 5/16/14, told us if a big group shows up, the puddles will probably be used up.	2014-05-16	danielle
2014-05-26	Halfway Trailcamp	Dry at the trail crossing.  There could be water further up the drainage, but I didn't check.  I just went to High Creek and got water there.	2014-05-24	Hikin' Jim
2014-05-26	High Creek Trailcamp	Decent flow in the smaller creek bed.  The larger creek bed that you come to first was dry.  Good flow at High Creek Falls downstream of the camping area.	2014-05-24	Hikin' Jim

Smaller creek down the trail below the "official" source:  Low flow, but flowing. - 3.  Small spring above Saxton Camp:  Just a trickle. - 4.  "Plummer Crossing" (where the W.

2014-05-27	Halfway Trailcamp	Some have reported Halfway as dry. It isn't. At the creek crossing (dry) 200 yards before camp, go upstream 50 yards (there's a trace trail to the left of the creek). You'll find pools with adequate flow. Better flow than observed in the fall. Probably won't last all summer.	2014-05-24	Ian Smith
2014-05-27	South Fork Meadows	Nice consistent flow!	2014-05-24	Sons of Vanarchy 
2014-06-01	Trailfork	Trickle coming out of pipe. flow rate was 90sec for 200ml; 2min for 8oz. took awhile to fill multiple bottles.	2014-05-30	Jim W

2014-06-16	Trailfork	Pipe is dry. Some usable puddles on the ground.	2014-06-14	Robert S
2014-06-17	Johns Meadow	Forsee Creek and the un-named creek on the west side of John's Meadow were both flowing. The flow was such that you could fill a 1 liter bottle in 30 seconds.	2014-06-15	Mike Blakely
2014-06-23	Limber Pine (.3 mi.west)	The Limber Pine Creek flow was sufficient to filter 6 - 8 liters of water in no time at all. At the switchback, it looked like a small trickle, a little difficult to filter from. About 50 feet up the creek from the switchback, you can recover water  from the stream and filter from there.	2014-06-22	Randy
2014-06-23	Jackstraw	Very low flow... just a trickle coming from spring.  enough to fill up a few canteens, and then if you wait, it will fill back up. -  - Puddle is located right next to the wooden plank crossing the place where the stream would be.  	2014-06-20	Daniel
2014-06-23	Trailfork	Very low flow/trickle coming from spring.  Pipe is dry.. puddle formed near pipe that is enough to fill some bottles if you are patient.  	2014-06-21	Daniel
2014-06-29	Lodgepole Spring	Bone dry,	2014-06-27	Chris P.
2014-06-30	Lodgepole Spring	Bone dry. The seep the previous post referenced, on the trail 1/2 mile before Dry Lake is still trickling.	2014-06-28	Ian Smith
2014-06-30	High Meadow Springs	Silty pockets of running water with algae in it in the meadow no more than two inches deep. Able to pump as much as we wanted but filter clogged quickly.	2014-06-28	Turtle
2014-07-07	Vivian Trailcamp	Good water flow from recent monsoon rains at the trail camp. 	2014-07-06	Jon Br
2014-07-07	High Creek Trailcamp	Good small flow where Vivian Creek trail crosses High Creek. Most likely from recent monsoon rains. Probably wont last very long though. 	2014-07-06	Jon B
2014-07-10	Limber Pine (.3 mi.west)	still running strong	2014-07-05	james cho

2014-07-14	Fish Creek	Slow but steady. I'd guess 1 liter per minute? Still enough to fill all your water needs but not sure about later summer.....	2014-07-13	Jeff
2014-07-21	High Creek Trailcamp	Same report as Jon B; the flow seemed pretty strong.	2014-07-18	Darren O
2014-07-24	Halfway Trailcamp	At now dry stream crossing just before the camp trail spur junction, turn left BEFORE the dry stream and go up along the dry stream bed.  Follow light social trail, step over one large log, at least 100 paces.  Look for very small (2' diam) pool on right in stream bed.  	2014-07-19	John Flippin
2014-07-27	Limber Pine (.3 mi.west)	Water flow was good, filled about 3 L in 5 minutes (including filter time). Climbed about 50 ft up from where stream meets trail. - Crisp and cold...best water in California!	2014-07-27	Sean

2014-10-05	High Meadow Springs	Plenty of water in multiple locations.  The water is shallow, so you have to take care not to stir up silt.  Low flow, but definitely usable. -  - I use a Sierra cup to gently scoop up water and pour it into another container.	2014-09-18	Hikin' Jim
2014-10-05	South Fork Meadows	Plenty of water in multiple locations. -  - The place where the trail crosses a creek before climbing to Dry Lake is running very low, but there are plenty of spots with good flow.	2014-09-19	Hikin' Jim

2014-11-16	Limber Pine (.3 mi.west)	The stream was completely frozen all the way through. Was able to chip away some small bits and pieces of ice and scrap up some of the small amounts of snow around it, but it took a lot of effort to get a little amount of water to boil down, clean, and make drinkable. 	2014-11-16	Veronica
