Just as the trail is curving left to enter the gap, turn right and walk cross-country down the slope through fairly open living (not burned) pine forest. A very short distance from the trail you'll drop into a small dry ravine. Go up the embankment on the other side to an old road bed. Turn left and follow the road another short distance down to the bottom of the drainage - you'll leave the road as it bears left. There will be a clearing on the right and a stream in the woods straight ahead. Total duration off the PCT just a few minutes. The creek drains a portion of N slope of Fuller Ridge. Lots of camping in the vicinity. The topography between the trail and the stream is very mellow. If you find yourself in very steep/sketchy terrain, you're in the wrong area.

However, camping is not allowed in the burn area and travel must be done in a day. Please do not leave the PCT as other trails and areas remain closed. Approximately four miles of PCT are within the burn perimeter. While the trail is open, this was a very intense burn in places and you should be careful. Hazards in recent burn areas may include: loose soils, rocks and trail tread, burned stump holes, hazard trees, unstable terrain and flash flooding and debris flows. Again, no camping is allowed in the burn area at this time. There has been some confusion about the status of the closure but the information above is correct and San Bernardino National Forest is working on clarifying the matter.\n4/27/17 per Pika & Paw Patrol: Info on the Lake Fire closure doesn't specify which miles don't allow camping, which was a little nerve-wracking for some I know -- I'd say no camping from 236-241 to be safe."

The trail makes an artificial bench along the hillside and with a little bit of rain, it washes right down into a gully in the middle of the bench which is where we all walk. Please advise to not walk directly behind someone in these very sooty areas as you will be breathing in a heavy carcinogen. Also be aware that many areas the trail are totallycovered with the decomposing granite tailings from above and very difficult to traverse some areas safely.

Recommend having Guthooks or route finding skills as the trail disappears from time to time. Ground was consistently covered in slushy snow starting at 8500 ft which is when the trail disappears for the most part. Lots of footprints going in various directions. Kicking steps rather than following others' footprints often made for better traction. Due to an injury, I also descended today with glissading being the easiest way down. Ice axe would have been nice but poles did the job in terms of controlling the short glissades. No need to take the alternate route. Brave the snow and enjoy the amazing view from the top!!"
