Just as the trail is curving left to enter the gap, turn right and walk cross-country down the slope through fairly open living (not burned) pine forest. A very short distance from the trail you'll drop into a small dry ravine. Go up the embankment on the other side to an old road bed. Turn left and follow the road another short distance down to the bottom of the drainage - you'll leave the road as it bears left. There will be a clearing on the right and a stream in the woods straight ahead. Total duration off the PCT just a few minutes. The creek drains a portion of N slope of Fuller Ridge. Lots of camping in the vicinity. The topography between the trail and the stream is very mellow. If you find yourself in very steep/sketchy terrain, you're in the wrong area.

However, camping is not allowed in the burn area and travel must be done in a day. Please do not leave the PCT as other trails and areas remain closed. Approximately four miles of PCT are within the burn perimeter. While the trail is open, this was a very intense burn in places and you should be careful. Hazards in recent burn areas may include: loose soils, rocks and trail tread, burned stump holes, hazard trees, unstable terrain and flash flooding and debris flows. Again, no camping is allowed in the burn area at this time. There has been some confusion about the status of the closure but the information above is correct and San Bernardino National Forest is working on clarifying the matter."
