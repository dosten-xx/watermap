I took this trail uphill (and to the north/left side of the drainage). It eventually curved back around to the bottom of the drainage and at that spot there was a sign on a tree that said \"Little Jamison Spring\" and there was a spring flowing with a small pool. That is what I'm reporting as the spring in my water report. The water from that seemed to go underground soon afterward sometime downhill, because when you looked downhill a ways there was no obvious water flowing. Also, there was no flow at the official creek crossing on the side trail even farther downhill either, so that water must be getting reabsorbed in the ground I guess.",

            "6/1/16 (Fat Sectioner) : Currently, the WACS1316 is at the point where the trail crosses Carter creek, 350 feet or so past the campsites.  If one follows the path past that, it crosses another (unnamed) creek that will later join Carter creek and have a much more substantial combined flow. To put that in a mileage log format: \n     * 0.0 miles: Leave PCT\n     * 0.4 miles: Campsite\n     * 0.45 miles: Carter Creek Crossing\n     * 0.5 miles: Unnamed Creek Crossing\n     * 0.6 miles: Confluence of two creeks 100 feet to the west of the trail\n     * 0.7 miles: Permanent (aka more than seasonal) creek about 50 feet to the west of the trail\n     *** To that end, at the Carter Meadows trail intersection on the PCT there's a sign that says \"permanent water 0.7 mi\".  And based on what I've seen, that makes a lot of sense.\n     However, the campsites are similar enough distance, one could easily assume that was the  0.7 miles (particularly with how off mileage can be on trail markers) and not \n     explore further down-stream. So what I'd recommend is adding waypoint WA1316 at location 40.2027,-121.4178 (that's the 0.6 mile item on the mileage log) with the\n     description: \"Permanent water on Carter Creek, further downstream of campsite.\"  If you'd prefer something even more substantial, you could use location\n     40.2042,-121,4166 that is 0.7miles downstream.  At that point the flow is so strong the creek can be seen from Google Earth imagery and the USGS topo maps show\n     another creek having joined in (although I didn't see it)."
