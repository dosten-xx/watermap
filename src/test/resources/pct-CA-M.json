      "6/1/16 (Fat Sectioner) : Currently, the WACS1316 is at the point where the trail crosses Carter creek, 350 feet or so past the campsites.  If one follows the path past that, it crosses another (unnamed) creek that will later join Carter creek and have a much more substantial combined flow. To put that in a mileage log format: \n     * 0.0 miles: Leave PCT\n     * 0.4 miles: Campsite\n     * 0.45 miles: Carter Creek Crossing\n     * 0.5 miles: Unnamed Creek Crossing\n     * 0.6 miles: Confluence of two creeks 100 feet to the west of the trail\n     * 0.7 miles: Permanent (aka more than seasonal) creek about 50 feet to the west of the trail\n     *** To that end, at the Carter Meadows trail intersection on the PCT there's a sign that says \"permanent water 0.7 mi\".  And based on what I've seen, that makes a lot of sense.\n     However, the campsites are similar enough distance, one could easily assume that was the  0.7 miles (particularly with how off mileage can be on trail markers) and not \n     explore further down-stream. So what I'd recommend is adding waypoint WA1316 at location 40.2027,-121.4178 (that's the 0.6 mile item on the mileage log) with the\n     description: \"Permanent water on Carter Creek, further downstream of campsite.\"  If you'd prefer something even more substantial, you could use location\n     40.2042,-121,4166 that is 0.7miles downstream.  At that point the flow is so strong the creek can be seen from Google Earth imagery and the USGS topo maps show\n     another creek having joined in (although I didn't see it)."

The Red Buttes Wilderness, boundary trail, and access trails (Ft. Goff, Portuguese Creek) remain closed.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNorthern California firefighters are working on numerous new lightning fires. The public is urged to be especially careful with fire. Remember ‘One less spark, one less wildfire.’ For more information see http://www.readyforwildfire.org/One-Less-Spark-Campaign/ .\nAdditional information about the Cedar Fire is available on the U.S. Forest Service – Klamath National Forest Facebook page, on Inciweb, and on bulletin boards in Happy Camp.
