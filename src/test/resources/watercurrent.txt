Water Sources on the  Arizona Trail  by Passages
Water Reliability scale:  0 = not reliable; 1 = seasonal or "iffy"; 2 = probable; 3 = fairly reliable; 4 = definite source.
Water reports are compiled from personal experiences, hikers, e-mails, phone calls, and trail journals.  Check regularly for updates.

Mileage -- south to north -- agrees with Arizona Trail Segment Passages and GPS data at www.aztrail.org. 
 Information in this report is provided as a service to the community.  Information in this report may not be accurate.  Natural water sources in Arizona
 can and do rapidly change.  Resupply box may be empty.  The user of this information is solely responsible for their own safety.  Hike your own hike.
Man made water sources are listed as TOWN or other facility.  Some locations may be closed and no water available.
The LOCATION will indicate if a water source is off trail with a note, such as 0.5m E
Abbreviations:  m  - mile; N - north; E -east; S - south; W - west.     "~" means "about"
It is recommended  that water sources be verified with local sources, such as Forest Service Ranger Stations, National Park Service, BLM
offices, or AZA Trail Stewards.  Water quality may vary greatly and it is recommend that water sources be treated to reduce risk of water borne diseases.
