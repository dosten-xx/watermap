SoCal Watermap is tool to use for planning your hikes given the water situation.
As you know, Southern California contains lots of desert terrain and natural water sources are hard to come by.
To help us hikers out, many people have put together great resources that provide status on the various water sources available to hikers.
This website consolidates these reports and displays them in a map for a snapshot view.
It is meant to be used in your pre-trip planning to see where you can expect water and plan your route around that information.
Also keep in mind that the original sources (always cited) will have additional details on the reports.

The color indicates the status of the source.  The data is updated once per day from source.
These are subjective states based on the report text.  This is kind of experimental so always check the text in the popup.
